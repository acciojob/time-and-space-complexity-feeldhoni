	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm and ,efficient  a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution and'O(n)' refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution</p>

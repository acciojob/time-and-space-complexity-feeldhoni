	<p> Time complexity efficient  a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size.</p>
	<p2><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution and O(n) refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution</p2>
